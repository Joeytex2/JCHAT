# This is a placeholder for ringtone.mp3
# Please replace this file with your own ringtone.mp3 file
# The ringtone should be in MP3 format and will be used for incoming calls
# 
# You can:
# 1. Download a ringtone from various sources
# 2. Convert an audio file to MP3 format
# 3. Create your own ringtone using audio editing software
#
# The file should be named exactly "ringtone.mp3" and placed in the same directory as Chat.html
# 
# If ringtone.mp3 is not found, the system will fallback to using ne.mp3 or generate a tone using Tone.js
